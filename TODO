* style classification of dialectal, nonstandard etc. forms (e.g. in
  kotus-sanalista)

* Adjectives should rarely take possessives

* Nouns should rarely compare

* Thorough derivational system

* Lots and lots of proper nouns

* Test suites, *test suites*, testing, *testing*, **testing**

* Extending word lists

* Broken vowel harmony should be allowed when harmony is over two syllables away

* Foreign words may use either visual or pronunciation based harmony

* The verb inflection stem patterns are too complex

* Some verbs should have defective paradigms: *tuulla : ?tuulen*

* some 28 class gradating bugs (j√§lsi, orsi)
