= Omorfi–Open source Morphology for Finnish language =

This package contains free and open source morphological lexical database for the Finnish language. This package is licenced under GNU GPL version 3, but not necessarily later. Licence can be found from `COPYING` file in root of the distribution package. Other licences are possible from authors named in the `AUTHORS`.

The dictionaries used in omorfi are [http://kaino.kotus.fi Nykysuomen sanalista] (LGPL),  [http://joukahainen.lokalisointi.org Joukahainen] (GPL) and [http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/research/finnwordnet FinnWordNet] (Princeton Wordnet licence / GPL; relicenced with kind permission from University of Helsinki), and [http://fi.Wiktionary.org Wiktionary] (Creative Commons Attribution–ShareAlike). Some words have also been collected by omorfi developers and contributors and are GPLv3 like the rest of the package.

== Downloading ==

Omorfi can be fetched from [http://code.google.com/p/omorfi/ Google code service]. You need to use the git source code repository since *Google has discontinued downloads*.

== Dependencies ==

Compilation of the morphological analyser, generation, lemmatisation or spell-checking requires [http://hfst.sf.net HFST] tools or compatible installed:

  * hfst-3.8 or greater is required for omorfi versions >2014
  * python-3 is needed to handle TSV database data
    * There's also simple python interface to the morphological analyser

The final transducers can be used with HFST tools or HFST runtime tools. The spell-checking automata package can be used with any common spell-checking interface through voikko spell-checking library.

== Installation ==

Installation uses standard autotools system:
{{{
  ./configure && make && make install
}}}
The compiling may take forever or more depending on the hardware and settings. The stable release versions should be compilable on average end-user systems.

If configure cannot find HFST tools, you must tell it where to find them:
{{{
  ./configure --with-hfst=${HFSTPATH}
}}}
Autotools system supports installation to e.g. home directory:
{{{
  ./configure --prefix=${HOME}
}}}
With git version you must create necessary autotools files in the host system once, after initial checkout:
{{{
  ./autogen.sh
}}}
For further instructions, see `INSTALL`, the GNU standard install instructions for autotools systems.

== Usage ==

Omorfi installs experimental scripts that are meant for easy command line based use of omorfi automata: `omorfi-analyse.sh` is a simple shell script invoking `hfst-proc` the tokenising analyser, which uses the morphological analyser to break the input into words and then analyses them. The basic usage:
{{{
  omorfi-analyse.sh [FILENAME]
}}}
So for basic analysis of a text file named `kalevala.txt` is:
{{{
  omorfi-analyse.sh kalevala.txt
}}}
or:
{{{
  omorfi-analyse.sh < kalevala.txt
}}}
The script `omorfi-interactive.sh` can be used to analyse pre-tokenised text or input one word form at a time from the shell (N.B. the input is read raw from command line, so special keys, such as arrows will not work).

For more information of these tools, invoke `--help`, or view their man pages:
{{{
  omorfi-analyse --help
  man omorfi-analyse
}}}

Other automata, such as tokeniser, segmentation, hyphenation or whatever, may be available in the build directories. These should be installed into `${prefix}/share/hfst/fi/` directory, which contains all the omorfi automata in HFST binary format. These can be manipulated by standard HFST tools.

== Note about character codings ==

This implementation of morphology uses UTF-8 encoded Unicode, and all relevant tools typically only process UTF-8 encoded format. On some systems, characters with potential diacritics, such as ä and ö, may be encoded differently; the implemented version uses a form of unicode where diacritics are precomposed to characters, also known as unicode normal form C (NFC). Systems using decomposed form (NFD), such as certain tools of Mac OS X, may experience problems.

== Contributing ==

Omorfi code and data are free and libre open source, modifiable and redistributable by anyone. To contribute code or data, use one of the contact channels listed in [http://code.google.com/p/omorfi/]. IRC channel [irc://Freenode/#omorfi #omorfi on Freenode networks] is especially good for immediate discussion about contributions. Any data or code contributed must be compatible with our licencing policy, i.e. GNU compatible free licence.
