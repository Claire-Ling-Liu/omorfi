# Introduction

While omorfi does not directly produce any finite-state automata etc. software,
it is possible that changes in lexicon and serialisation affect the running
time of the automata. This page contains automated tests per release for omorfi
to give you an idea of how fast the components might be.

# Automated tests

They are in ascending order by dates because I just >> the new results to the
