# Notes about the smaller lexicon version of omorfi

From 2017 onwards omorfi has included support for optional smaller, higher
quality word list lexicon. This version contains only the words found in the
*Nykysuomen sanalista* and a handful of high frequency tokens verified by omorfi
team. This version is also suitable for limited memory and processing power
devices, e.g. I (flammie) use it on my Asus eee mini laptop when travelling and
developing; the compilation of large lexicon requires over 2 Gigabytes of RAM.

If you use the smaller lexicon in your scientific work, you must state that
clearly in any publications.
